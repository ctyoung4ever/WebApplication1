<!--A paragraph on what you hope to get out of this IS 413 class-->
<p>
    For this IS 413 class, I am hoping to gain the experience necessary to bring value to the business I choose<br />
    to work for in my internships and careers. I hope to gain a solid understanding of C# and how it interacts with ASP.net, <br />
    as well as how to build websites that
    can be dynamically made through the MCV.
